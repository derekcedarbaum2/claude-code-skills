So, I have an idea for an application that I've always wanted to build — not always, excuse me — that I've been thinking about building over the last maybe six or twelve months. I'm not an engineer, I'm not a designer, so I don't really have the skill set to make the tool, but with the rise of AI coding agents, it may actually be possible.

So what I would like to do is work with you to create a specification that is of sufficient fidelity that you could build the application and we can iterate on it from there.

I don't know anything about how to host the code. As I'm working on it, I don't know anything about IDEs or GitHub or GitLab or where maybe an iOS application is stored or its web app equivalent. So I'm going to need your help along the way to figure out the correct tech stack and the correct languages to use as I tell you what I'm thinking of.

First I'd like to build this for myself, but I would also like to make it so that other people can sign up and use it as well. And so I also don't know anything about databases or payments, systems or auth for passwords and logins and all of that, so keep that in mind as well.

Okay, so I'm going to tell you what I have in mind.

I have a two and a half year old son and an 11 month old daughter and an eight year old stepdaughter. Since the birth of my now 11 month old daughter, I've been thinking a bit more about life and death, my legacy, what I'd like to leave behind to them when I leave this world — hopefully not prematurely, but even if prematurely.

I started working on some estate planning, my wills, and thinking about quite literally what I would leave behind if and when I pass away. I've thought about things I've seen in shows or movies about parents who have left behind video messages to their children, leaving a final message, if you will.

And so I've always wanted to create a video, but then I thought, ah, you know, if I were to just do a single video, how much could they really know about me, my thoughts, my feelings?

I also like to read biographies of people who have done great deeds in this world. Of course, I aspire to doing great deeds, but thought at the very least it would be great to write a memoir or have a biography of my life just as a matter of record.

I may not ever get to writing that memoir and I may not ever be important enough for someone else to write that biography. However, I believe with the state of today's technology in AI and software, there is a path to producing such work.

As a small side note — I've also always aspired to write diary entries. And every few years I pick up a diary book and start writing daily entries and then let it go. I just think about how I'm just going to put that book in a closet and maybe or maybe not ever write it again.

And so what I would like — and what I think I would be more inclined to use — is a sort of app-based diary where every day, or any day that I want, or any time that I want, I can enter a diary entry. I can record a voice note or a video of myself and talk about my day, talk about thoughts I had that day. If I took photos, I can upload the photos from my phone and attach it to that voice note or video recording, or if I type a text-based diary entry. I can store that as a diary entry.

Now over time I will have — say out of 365 days a year — recorded entries 300 days that year. What I could do with that is ask an AI agent to take all entries and leverage the equivalent of a Claude Code skill of a kind of writing style that I've pre-selected or updated over the years, so that the application can ingest all of my diary entries — whether it's video or voice or text or image — and can analyze all that information and write a biographical account of all of my entries as if it were a chapter in a book of my life.

Over time, as video models become less expensive, I can also use the photos, the videos, the voice recordings to have the AI generate a documentary or a chapter of the documentary. If I like those chapters I can store those chapters, but I can also keep all the diary entries. So that over the years — hopefully I use this day in and day out over the course of 20, 30 or 40 years — at various points I can ask the application to generate a biographical account of my life. I can ask it to generate a documentary of my life. I can ask it to include or exclude certain events.

I would also like for the application to have a chat interface where, as I ask for a generation of an account or a biographical chapter, the application asks me questions about themes of my life, moods of my life, best days, worst days — looking at writing entries and asking for clarification on something as a biographer may want. The application to act like a biographer and to inquire and be inquisitive as a biographer would be.

Even on day-to-day entries — whether voice or text — after the application has analyzed the entry, I'd like it to ask questions, act as an interviewer, to ask for refinement, to poke holes, or to make sure that the entry is full, so that when we are to generate a biographical account it can do so in a way that provides a beautiful narrative.

I'm still trying to think about how it can be used in a way where day-to-day it's sticky — meaning after a recording of some sort with whatever text or image or video or voice-based inputs are provided, there is an output available to share via Twitter or Instagram or Substack. I haven't quite figured out what that could or should look like and I'd like us to actually talk about that. But ultimately this is about how to curate an account of my life at either the smallest level — meaning a single memory — or the largest level — meaning my life.

I've had thoughts about how it can also be used as a productivity tool — in terms of what did I get done this week, what would I like to get done next week — and so the biographer could also act as a coach with suggestions. But I'm not sure how that user experience could play out in the same kind of cohesive theme as this AI biographer.

I haven't necessarily thought of a name for the product but it could be something along the lines of "Biographer," maybe something more catchy or sticky.

This is the initial thoughts I have on building this application. In terms of other features: I would like to be able to set times of day where I get notifications from the application to ask for a journal entry. Maybe some people want to do it at 6 a.m. when they first wake up, maybe some people want to do it at 7 p.m. right before they go to sleep. I'd like the application to have reminders. When we're about to record a video, to be in good lighting, to use the highest quality video settings — highest quality video settings is preferable.

When it listens to the audio, I'd like the application to leverage an AI tool to analyze the voice, the audio, to ensure that it is of sufficient quality. And if a word seems garbled, call it out and go to the transcript of itself and ask the user to clarify. And you can either type the change, edit the change, or press the record button to tell the application to make a certain change — and just make sure we're more clear in our enunciations or in a quiet area.

I would like there to be a feature so that if you pass away, others have access to the account. Forget what that feature is called, but some type of sharing feature to confirm the passing of the user in order to acquire all of those memories. Could be that if the user doesn't sign in for a year or two years, an email gets sent to the selected list — such as spouses and children — to receive the entire repository of entries and a fully generated biographical or documentary account of that individual's life.

There's definitely more to the interview mode. Questions can be asked before as just a text prompt that we can design upon user onboarding. As the AI models get better, I would love for a voice avatar — maybe leveraging something like the ElevenLabs voice models, or lower cost Gemini/Google voice models — to act as an avatar, to ask questions so you can kind of converse with the interviewer via video or via voice.

It would be absolutely beautiful for the videos to seem like there's an off-screen interviewer asking questions about your day, and based off of your responses, it will ask follow-up questions. Of course, there's currently latency issues, but we're to assume that over the next 12 to 24 months, those latency issues will completely go away.

This is my current idea. I want you to use the user interview tool to ask me dozens of questions about what I just articulated so you can get clarification, and then we'll use all the answers and this transcript to write the initial spec. Once the initial spec is written, we will have you analyze that spec — and I want you to pretend to be the best product manager at Anthropic to identify ways to improve the spec more.

I also want to be able to have some type of system configuration via web app that's tied to the same database that the iOS app would be tied to — for configuring interviewer questions, avatars, voice models, and the like. Even doing your diary entries on your computer if you feel like it, where you can access your camera, your microphone — similar, same as the iOS app.

Okay, that's a good start, let's get going.
