# Biographer - Product Discovery in Claude Code

This folder contains the complete product discovery process for Biographer, an AI-powered biographical diary app. The entire process was conducted in Claude Code using custom skills, starting from a raw voice memo and ending with a full product specification.

I am not an engineer. I recorded a 14-minute voice memo describing what I wanted to build, then used Claude Code to run structured product discovery against myself: 10 rounds, 54 questions, 60 decisions locked in.

## What You Are Looking At

Read these in order:

1. **Voice Transcript** - The raw starting point. A 14-minute voice memo transcribed and loaded into Claude Code. This is how the idea existed in my head before any structure was applied.

2. **Interview Q&A** - 10 rounds of structured product discovery. Claude Code acted as the interviewer, I answered. Each round digs deeper: core experience, AI personality, digital legacy, social sharing, onboarding, business model, content architecture, public features, edge cases, and a final PM spec review to close gaps.

3. **Product Memory** - The persistent specification that was built and updated across sessions. 42 features, 60 decisions, a full decisions log with dates, anti-patterns (what the product is NOT), open questions, and a session log tracking how the spec evolved.

## What This Demonstrates

- Starting from a voice memo and ending with a shippable spec, entirely in Claude Code
- Structured decision-making: every major question has a recorded answer and rationale
- Willingness to kill features ("drop coaching, it muddies the biographer identity")
- Thinking about hard problems: data privacy vs. AI processing, digital legacy triggers, contradiction handling, public vs. private content
- The product itself is an AI-native consumer application

## The Product

Biographer captures a user's life through daily entries (voice, video, text, photos) and uses AI to synthesize those entries into biographical chapters, memoirs, and documentary-style content. It acts as a personal biographer: interviewing the user, asking follow-up questions, and curating a narrative of their life over years and decades. Features include a public AI biographer others can interact with, a digital legacy system, and social sharing outputs.
